    <h1>Group __ Product Website</h1>

    <h2>Product Info</h2>
<p>Our product is an intranet site the user requested to assist the HRDC employees/volunteers in accessing timecards and finding specific forms or any other forms/information the user would be looking for. 
Some features we have been asked to implement would be a search function to browse the Google Drive for any forms needed. Some user functionality, where an administrator can post announcements to the main page for workers/volunteers to see (upcoming time card due dates, training, training videos, W-2 forms, etc.). 
Some additional features will are looking to implement would be; creating profiles with login access for the administrators to post announcements and a login for employees/volunteers so they can access any forms that may pertain directly to the individual (W-2 forms, employee training documents, payroll forms; if applicable, etc).
Some of the key technologies we are looking to implement NextJS as our framework, GitHub to save our project files, Google Drive, specifically, the HRDC Google Drive to sort and organize important files or forms for the organization.
Additionally, we are exploring different page designs that will be easily usable and understandable for elderly, visually impaired, and non-native speaking individuals.
For any additional features, technologies, tools, or frameworks we will be using or changing during the design we will contact Krista from the HRDC to confirm it is in the layout/design the clients are looking for.

    <h2>User Documentation</h2>
    <p>This product will allow HRDC administrators, workers, and volunteer users to find specific HRDC forms, to see company announcements or other important information from leadership. This website will be purposely designed to allow those with little computer literacy to easily use and navigate the website and get the information they need so that the HRDC admin doesnâ€™t have to heavily assist employees/volunteers in finding forms they need to fill out.
This intranet will be connected to the HRDC website through a subdomain.
Users will need to access this intranet through the subdomain.
The software will be a simple and user-friendly way to access important links to different forms and software used within HRDC along with view announcements. Users can search for these links or click on frequently used links at the top of the webpage. Supervisors will have access to admin features that allow features, such as updating the announcements and adding or removing links.
Users should alert their supervisor of any bugs or issues that may appear while using the software. This can be done through an email or verbal communication. As developers, we will have an error backlog for any future developers for maintenance purposes.

    <h2>Developer Documentation</h2>
    <p>How to obtain source code
The source code is accessible through the Github project account. The source code can also be found in the final project hosted on the web. 
Planned Directory Structure
We are making a two-level directory structure. This is due to its ability to separate directories for each user. 
How to Build
The initial building block for this website is Next.js. Additional files will be added to implement future features.
How to Test
We will be doing black box testing specifically focusing on users who are in our target market, elderly and non technical users. 
Automated Build and Test 
There is no automated building and testing implemented currently but will be implemented as needed.
How to release a version 
Each new version will be released on GitHib.
Bug tracker (See Issues in GitHub)
Bugs will be tracked in a page called Issues located in GitHub.
GOOD comments should be found in any source code
We will use good commenting practices to make our code understandable to current and future users.

Rule 1: Comments should not duplicate the code.

Rule 2: Good comments do not excuse unclear code.

Rule 3: If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.

Rule 4: Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.

Rule 5: Explain unidiomatic code in comments.

Rule 6: Provide links to the original source of copied code.

Rule 7: Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.

Rule 8: Add comments when fixing bugs.

Rule 9: Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
